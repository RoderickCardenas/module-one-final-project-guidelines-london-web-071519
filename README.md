Welcome to Gamer JunkFood
//////

This app is for all the gaming lovers out there who would like to come and see what's a must buy game versus ones that well, maybe just try to avoid....

You need to create an account to write reviews and then have access to them for edits etc but you will be able to view all the games in our database as well as the reviews attached to them!

You can choose which reviews (of your own) that you would like to edit.

Deletions cannot be reversed so be sure that you would like to permanently remove a review of yours before deleting.

You can also change your username after registering (as long as it's not already taken that is!).

Use the up and down arrows to navigate the page and when logged into the main menu, the left and right arrows will help you navigate by page.

Enjoy!
